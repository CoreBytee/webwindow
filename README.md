# webwindow

Wrapper around `tr1ckydev/webview-bun` to not freeze the main event loop.

## üì¶ Installation

To install `@corebyte/webwindow` using `bun`:

```bash
bun add @corebyte/webwindow
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Before creating a window, ensure you call `Window.check()` at the first line of your index file to verify the environment is properly set up:

```javascript
import { Window } from '@corebyte/webwindow';

Window.check(); 
```

Here's a basic example of how to use `@corebyte/webwindow`:

```javascript
import { Window } from "@corebyte/webwindow";

const window = new Window({
  title: "My Web Window",
  url: "https://example.com",
  size: { width: 800, height: 600 },
});

window.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Window closed");
});
```

> **Note:** Every time you edit a property of the window, the window needs to reload for the changes to take effect.
